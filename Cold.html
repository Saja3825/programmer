<h2>9 Signs It's More Serious Than the Common Cold</h2>

<img src="image/cold1.jpg" width="50%">


<p>The common cold tends to clear up on its own in three to four days, says Melisa Lai Becker, MD, site chief of emergency medicine at Cambridge Health Alliance. It starts with a scratchy throat, congestion, and runny nose, and then a cough usually develops. While your cough and post-nasal drip may linger, most head cold symptoms should disappear after four days.

"With a cold, you ultimately feel OK after a couple days of rest, hydration, and Kleenex," she says.

If symptoms last for longer, it’s possible you have something more worrisome, such as the flu or mononucleosis.To be safe, make an appointment with your physician.

</li>

<li>
	<b>  You recently returned from a big trip</b>
	<p>Recent international travel is a red flag for doctors because it could mean you have a less-conventional infection they wouldn’t have normally considered, explains Stella Safo, MD, an internist at Mount Sinai Hospital who specializes in infectious diseases. It’s important to see a doctor if you have any symptoms after returning from a trip abroad.

</p>
</li>

<li>
<b> You have a high fever</b>
<p>The question of "Can you have a fever with a cold?" is a tricky one. While it's definitely possible to be feverish when you have a cold, it's not common—especially high fevers.

If you have a fever at or above 101 degrees Fahrenheit, it could be a sign of strep throat, says Dr. Lai Becker. Most patients with strep will develop a high fever in the first few days of illness, so be wary of sudden spikes in your temperature. "Strep throat is one thing you really want to distinguish from a cold," she says. "Left untreated, it can cause rheumatic fever and lead to serious heart problems."</p>
	
</li>

<li>
	<b>   You’ve had a low-grade fever for days</b>
<p>Even if your fever isn’t particularly high, running a low-grade fever for several days in a row could be a sign your body is trying to fight off more than a cold, says Dr. Lai Becker. A consistent fever could mean you actually have the flu or mono—so be diligent about checking it, even if it doesn’t feel super intense.

</p>
	
</li>

<li>
	<b>You’re having stomach issues</b>
<p>Having nausea with a cold—as well as vomiting and diarrhea—isn't typical, so symptoms like these could signal something more serious, such as the flu. It’s important to get medical attention if you’re experiencing these symptoms consistently, as they can cause you to become dehydrated, says Dr. Mysore.</p>
	
</li>

<li>
	<b>You’re experiencing chest pain or trouble breathing</b>
<p>Even though a cough is a normal symptom of a cold, it shouldn’t be so severe that it causes shortness of breath, wheezing, or chest pain, says Dr. Mysore. These symptoms shouldn’t be ignored, since breathing trouble could be a sign of bronchitis or pneumonia, while chest pain, tightness, and sudden shortness of breath could signal a pulmonary embolism (a blood clot blockage in the lungs).</p>
	
</li>

<li>
<b>Your symptoms are in one location</b>
<p>Another red flag it’s more than a cold is a “localization” of symptoms, meaning you feel them in one specific area, explains Dr. Safo. While cold symptoms affect the whole upper respiratory system, other illnesses are characterized by intense symptoms in one place. For example, Dr. Lai Becker points out that strep causes a sore throat so bad it’s difficult to swallow, but typically won’t cause pain throughout the body. Sinus infections can cause headaches and even make your teeth hurt, an ear infection will usually cause pain and congestion in one ear, and mono can cause swollen tonsils.</p>
		
</li>

<li>
	<b>You have body aches</b>
<p>A regular cold is no walk in the park, but it shouldn’t cause all-over body aches and pains. On the other hand, the flu can make your muscles and body feel achy, and can also be accompanied by fatigue and chills.

"With the flu, you’ll feel like you got hit by a truck," says Dr. Mysore. Just getting out of bed will wear you out, and your muscles will be tender and sore.</p>
	
</li>


<li>
	
	<b>There’s a pattern to your symptoms</b>
<p>It can be hard to , since they have similar symptoms. But allergies will often follow a pattern, says Dr. Lai Becker. If you notice your symptoms are worse after spending time outside or with a pet, or they tend to come and go with a certain season, you likely have allergies. “I had one patient who thought he was sick, but the real story was that he was allergic to a cat,” Dr. Lai Becker says.

To pinpoint the exact cause, keep track of your symptom history and see if you notice any trends; it could mean you’re allergic to something or have seasonal allergies.</p>

<h3>14 Foods to Eat When You Have a Cold</h3>
<img src="image/cold2.jpg" width="50%">


<p>When you’re sick, especially with a cold or the flu, sometimes food can be a real turnoff. But the right foods and beverages can offer relief—either from the symptoms of a cold or to help strengthen your immune system—so you can get better faster. Here are 14 cold-fighting foods to focus on, and simple ways to incorporate them when you’re under the weather. Some may even help your immune system fend off a cold, or reduce its severity or length. So stock up!</p>




 <b> Chamomile tea</b>
 <p> Chamomile consumption has been tied to an increase in antibacterial activity in the body. But its real impact may be its ability to support sleep, which protects immunity. In one study, postpartum women who drank chamomile tea for a few weeks reported better sleep quality compared to those who didn’t consume chamomile. Sip hot or iced, or use the steeped tea as the liquid for smoothies or oatmeal.</p>


 <b>Turmeric</b>


<p>
Curcumin, the natural compound in turmeric responsible for its vibrant color, is a potent anti-inflammatory compound. It has also been shown to boost immune cell activity and enhance antibody responses. Just be sure to combine turmeric with black pepper, which significantly ups curcumin bioavailability. Sprinkle a turmeric black pepper combo onto a smoothie, soup, broth, or cooked veggies.</p>


<b>Dried tart cherries</b>
<p>
The high antioxidant content in dried tart cherries is tied to a bolstered immune system, including a reduced risk of upper respiratory tract symptoms. These gems also support healthy sleep due to their natural melatonin content. That’s key, because research shows that people who don't get enough sleep or quality sleep are more likely to get sick after being exposed to a virus, such as the common cold. Pop them as is, or stir into nut butter and eat off a spoon.</p>




<b>Walnuts</b>

<p>
In addition to being one of the top anti-inflammatory foods, walnuts contain several nutrients that play a role in supporting the immune system, including vitamins E and B6, copper, and folate. Walnuts have also been shown in research to reduce psychological stress. That’s vital because unchecked stress weakens immunity. Pair walnuts with dried tart cherries as a snack, or chop and use as a garnish for fresh fruit or cooked veggies.</p>




<b>Extra virgin olive oil</b>
<p>
Extra virgin olive oil, or EVOO, possesses antibacterial properties that can reduce your risk of becoming sick. Its antioxidants have also been shown to protect against immune-mediated inflammatory conditions, including diabetes, obesity, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Saute your leafy greens in EVOO, or drizzle over a nutrient rich, easy to digest carb, like skin on potatoes</p>





<b>Soup or broth</b>
<p>
For decades, caretakers have been doling out chicken or other broth-based soups to cold sufferers, and there is some science to support its benefit. The effect is threefold. The steam from soup or broth speeds up the movement of mucus through the nose to relieve congestion. A healthy soup also helps reduce inflammation.

That’s important, because catching a cold triggers an inflammatory response in your upper respiratory tract, which contributes to symptoms like a stuffy nose. Also, the salt from soup or broth will cause your body to retain more water, and easing dehydration can help lessen symptoms like headache and dry mouth. If you don’t eat chicken, opt for vegetable broth, flavored with add-ins like garlic, ginger, cayenne, turmeric, and black pepper.</p>



<b>Cayenne pepper</b>
<p>
Spicy peppers, including cayenne powder, help thin mucus to relieve nasal congestion. Capsaicin, the compound that gives spicy peppers their heat, may also help suppress a cough. Add a pinch of ground cayenne to your tea, soup, or broth

 </p>


<b>Garlic</b>
<p>
Historically, garlic has been used to ward off illnesses, fight infections, and treat wounds—and research lends credibility to garlic’s immune-supporting capabilities. In one older study, 146 volunteers were assigned to receive either a placebo or a garlic supplement daily for 12 weeks throughout cold season. The garlic group experienced significantly fewer colds compared to the placebo group, and they recovered faster if they did get infected.Newer research confirms that aged garlic extract may enhance immune cell function.</p>


<b>Raw honey</b>
<p>
In addition to its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, raw honey has been shown to help ease coughs in children. Manuka honey, a variety native to New Zealand but available in the US, may specifically help bolster immunity.  Take it off a spoon to soothe your throat and potentially relieve a cough, or stir it into to your chamomile tea.</p>


<b>Ginger
</b>
<p>
Ginger eases nausea, and like raw honey, possesses antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. For the best benefits, opt for fresh ginger root. Slice or grate and add to tea, broth, smoothies, juice, or sprinkle over fresh fruit.</p>




<b>Bananas</b>
<p>
Bananas are one of the easiest foods on the digestive system and remain one of the few appealing foods when appetite is diminished due to illness. They also raise blood sugar and provide energy while delivering key nutrients that help support the immune system, including vitamins C and B6, copper, and folate. They’re also chock full of potassium, an electrolyte lost in sweat. Eat them as is, mash and drizzle with raw honey and fresh grated ginger, blend into a smoothie, or freeze and eat as an icy pop.</p>




<b>Lemon</b>
 
<p>
A quarter cup of fresh-squeezed lemon juice provides 30% of the daily target for vitamin C, and the juice from one whole lemon supplies about 50%. In addition to supporting immunity, this nutrient, which also acts as an antioxidant, is needed for DNA repair and serotonin production. The latter helps promote happiness and sleep. Add fresh-squeezed lemon juice to hot or chilled water or hot tea</p>



<b>Pomegranate juice</b>
<p>
Pure pomegranate juice is another food that supports immunity via its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity. The flavonoid antioxidants found in pomegranate juice have also been shown to combat viruses and decrease the length of a cold by as much as 40%. Sip on pomegranate juice, add splashes to water or chamomile tea, blend into smoothies, or freeze in BPA free molds, along with pureed banana and ginger root, to make popsicles.</p>





<b>Green vegetables</b>
<p>
Green veggies provide anti-inflammatory antioxidants, as well as key nutrients known to help the immune system function, including vitamins A and C and folate. They also provide bioactive compounds that provide a chemical signal that optimizes immunity in the gut, the location of 70-80% of immune cells. Saute veggies in EVOO along with garlic, turmeric, and black pepper, or add them to soup. You can also blend leafy greens, like kale or spinach, into a smoothie.

It’s also important to drink plenty of water to replace the fluid you’re losing through your lungs each time you cough, and from losses due to perspiration or sweat. As far as what to avoid when you’re sick, steer clear of foods that may fuel inflammation or stress your immune system. I advise my clients to avoid refined sugar, processed foods (especially those with artificial ingredients), conventional dairy and meat, caffeine, and alcohol.</p>
