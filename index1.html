<h2 class="myhealth">Health Meaning</h2>

<p class="textt"> The meaning of health has evolved over time. In keeping with the biomedical perspective, early definitions of health focused on the theme of the body's ability to function; health was seen as a state of normal function that could be disrupted from time to time by disease. An example of such a definition of health is: "a state characterized by anatomic, physiologic, and psychological integrity; ability to perform personally valued family, work, and community roles; ability to deal with physical, biological, psychological, and social stress".   </p>

 <h2>  Carbon Monoxide Poisoning (CO)</h2>
 <img src="image/dise1.jpg" width="40%">



<p>Silence isn’t always golden, especially when it comes to carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. CO is an odorless, colorless gas that can cause sudden illness and death. When power outages occur after severe weather, such as winter storms, using alternative sources of power can cause CO to build-up in a home and poison the people and animals inside. The most common symptoms of CO poisoning are headache, dizziness, weakness, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, and confusion. High levels of CO inhalation can cause loss of consciousness and death.</p>

<p>
There are steps you can take to help protect yourself and your household from CO poisoning. Change the batteries in your CO detector every six months. If you don’t have a battery-powered or battery back-up CO detector, buy one soon.</p>
<p>
CO is found in fumes produced by furnaces, stoves, lanterns, and gas ranges, or by burning charcoal and wood. CO from these sources can build up in enclosed or partially enclosed spaces. People and animals in these spaces can be poisoned and can die from breathing CO.</p>




<h3><b> Key Facts</b></h3>  
<ul>
	<li>
Every year, at least 430 people die in the U.S. from accidental CO poisoning.</li>
<li>
Approximately 50,000 people in the U.S. visit the emergency department each year due to accidental CO poisoning.</li>
<li>
Red blood cells pick up CO quicker than they pick up oxygen.</li>
<li>
When you inhale CO, your body replaces the oxygen in blood with CO.</li>
<li>
People who are sleeping or who have been drinking alcohol can die from CO poisoning before ever having symptoms.</li>


</ul>

 <h3>CO Poisoning Prevention Tips</h3>
 <ul>
 

<li>  Never use a gas range or oven to heat a home.</li>
<li>
Never leave the motor running in a vehicle parked in an enclosed or partially enclosed space, such as a garage.</li>
<li>
Never run a generator, pressure washer, or any gasoline-powered engine inside a basement, garage, or other enclosed structure, even if the doors or windows are open, unless the equipment is professionally installed and vented. Keep vents and flues free of debris, especially if winds are high. Flying debris can block ventilation lines.</li>
<li>
Never run a motor vehicle, generator, pressure washer, or any gasoline-powered engine less than 20 feet from an open window, door, or vent where exhaust can vent into an enclosed area.
Never use a charcoal grill, hibachi, lantern, or portable camping stove inside a home, tent, or camper.</li>
<li>
If conditions are too hot or too cold, seek shelter with friends or at a community shelter.</li>
<li>
If CO poisoning is suspected, consult a health care professional right away.</li>

     <h2>  Have You or a Family Member Had Colon Cancer?</h2>
 <img src="image/dise2.jpg" width="40%">
 <p>Having a family health history of colorectal (colon) cancer can make you more likely to get colorectal cancer yourself. If you have close family members with colorectal cancer, collect your family health history of colorectal and other cancers, and share this information with your doctor. Be sure to have any screening tests that your doctor recommends. If you have had colorectal cancer, make sure that your family members know about your diagnosis, especially if you have Lynch syndrome.</p>


<h3>  Why is it Important to Know Your Family Health History?</h3>
<p>
If you have a family health history of colorectal cancer, your doctor may consider your family health history when deciding which colorectal cancer screening might be right for you. For example, if you have a close family member who had colorectal cancer at a young age or have multiple close family members with colorectal cancer, your doctor may recommend the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>start screening at a younger age,</li>
<li>get screened more frequently,</li>
<li>use colonoscopy only instead of other tests, and 
in some cases, have genetic counseling.</li></ul>
<p>
The genetic counselor may recommend genetic testing based on your family health history. When collecting your family health history, be sure to include your close relatives: parents, brothers, sisters, children, grandparents, aunts, uncles, nieces, and nephews. List any cancers that each relative had and at what age he or she was diagnosed. For relatives who have died, list age and cause of death. You can use the My Family Health Portrait tool to collect your family health history.

<h2> WHAT IS PHYSICAL FITNESS?</h2>

 <img src="image/fitness1.jpg" width="40%">
<p>
Physical fitness is an important part of life. It is an indicator which shows whether you have the ability to perform and enjoy day to day physical activities with ease.
</p> <p>
Physical fitness is generally achieved through -
</p>
<ul>

<li>physical activity and exercise</li>

<li>correct nutrition</li>

<li>enough rest (good quality sleep)</li>

<li>Stress management and relaxation</li>

<h3>Definition of Physical Fitness:</h3>
<p>
So what is Physical Fitness after all?
</p>
<p>
Physical fitness is defined as the state of general well being, physically sound and healthy, along with mental stability.
<p>
Previously fitness was commonly defined as the capacity of the person to meet the physical demands of daily life and carry out the day’s activities without undue fatigue.
</p>
<p>
However, because of increased leisure time, changes in lifestyles rendered this definition insufficient. These days, physical fitness is considered a measure of the body’s ability to function efficiently and effectively in work and leisure activities, to be healthy, to resist hypo-kinetic diseases, and to meet emergency situations.

    	<h1>Face & Body</h1>
    <h2> Chemical Peels and Your Skin</h2>
    <img src="image/beauty1.jpg" width="40%">

<p> Chemical peels can improve the skin's appearance. In this treatment, a chemical solution is applied to the skin, which makes it "blister" and eventually peel off. The new skin is usually smoother and less wrinkled than the old skin.</p>
<p>
Chemical peels can be done on the face, neck, or hands. They can be used to:
</p>
 



<ul>
	
<li>
Reduce fine lines under the eyes and around the mouth	
</li>
<li>Treat wrinkles caused by sun damage and aging</li>
<li>Improve the appearance of mild scars</li>
<li>
Treat certain types of acne</li>
<li>Reduce age spots, freckles, and dark patches (melasma) due to pregnancy or taking birth control pills
Improve the look and feel of skin</li>
</ul>



 
<p>
Areas of sun damage may improve after chemical peeling.
</p>
 
<p>
After a chemical peel, skin is temporarily more sensitive to the sun, so wear sunscreen every day. It should say "broad-spectrum" on the label, meaning it protects against the sun's UVA and UVB rays. Also, it should be a physical sunscreen and be above SPF 30. Limit your time in the sun, especially between the hours of 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., and wear a wide-brimmed hat.

</p>



<h3>Who Is a Good Candidate For a Chemical Peel?</h3>

<p>
Generally, fair-skinned and light-haired patients are better candidates for chemical peels. If you have darker skin, you may also have good results, depending upon the type of problem being treated. But you also may be more likely to have an uneven skin tone after the procedure.
</p>
<p>
 
Skin sags, bulges, and more severe wrinkles do not respond well to chemical peels. They may need other kinds of cosmetic surgical procedures, such as laser resurfacing, a facelift, brow lift, eyelid lift, or soft tissue filler (collagen or fat). A dermatologic surgeon can help determine the most appropriate type of treatment for you.</p>

<h2>Can Your Hair Pass the Test?</h2>
<img src="image/beauty2.jpg" width="40%">
<p>

Is every day a "bad hair day" for you? If your troubles come from dry or damaged locks, regular styling might hurt more than help. Take a dry strand and gently pull both ends to stretch it. If it breaks easily, you don't have enough moisture in your hair.</p>


<br>
<br>

    <div class="media-body">
      <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">A Better Brand of Moisturizer</h5>

      
A lot of products saythey’re moisturizing on the label. In reality, they might simply coat your hair to make it feel softer. Look for products with natural oils like olive or argan oil, or glycerin, sorbitol, or shea butter. But stay away from shampoos with mineral oil and petrolatum, which keep outside moisture from getting in.
    </div>
  </li>
  <li class="media my-4">
    <img src="image/beauty4.jpg" class="mr-3" alt="..." width="30%">
    <div class="media-body">
      <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1"> Heat: Friend or Enemy?</h5>

Heat is still the best way to get a sleek, smooth look. But you do need to protect your hair from damage caused by blow dryers, curling irons, and flat irons. Apply a heat styling cream while your hair is damp. If you have fine hair, set your styling tools to low. Medium and coarse hair can handle slightly higher temperatures.
    </div>
  </li>
  <li class="media">
    <img src="image/beauty5.jpg" class="mr-3" alt="..." width="30%">
    <div class="media-body">
      <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">Let Go of Some Length</h5>
 

Why are you holding on to those scraggly ends? General rule of thumb: Trim dead ends every 6 to 8 weeks, especially if you use hot tools regularly. Stylists warn against snipping strands at home because dull scissors can fray your ends even more. Plus, cutting the back of your hair in a straight line isn't easy!

<h3>Better Brows and Lashes</h3>







<ul class="list-unstyled">

    <div class="media-body">
      <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1"> Can You Pluck The Tops?</h5>
  
It's OK as long as you focus on the peach fuzz there and on your temples. Most of the real shaping should happen underneath to lift the brow up. Pluck too much off the top and you could get flat brows that make you look scowly.
    </div>
  </li>
  <li class="media my-4">
    <img src="image/beauty8.jpg" class="mr-3" alt="..." width="30%">
    <div class="media-body">
      <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">  When to Put the Tweezers Down</h5>
  
If you see a teeny little dot of hair growing under the skin, resist the urge to pull it. You don’t want to break the skin and risk a scar. Wait a day and that little hair probably will poke through the surface, ready to be plucked. In the meantime, if it bothers you, cover it with concealer.
    </div>
  </li>
  <li class="media">
    <img src="image/beauty9.jpg" class="mr-3" alt="..." width="30%">
    <div class="media-body">
      <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">Open Your Eyes</h5>
      
Curled lashes make you look wide-eyed. Do it before you put on mascara. Use firm pressure but don't clamp down too hard. You don't want to pinch your skin, crease your lashes, or pull them out. You may get better results from curling in stages, moving out from the lash roots to the tips. A corner lash curler can get to hard-to-reach outer ones.

<b> 41–43: Dairy</b>
<p>
For those who can tolerate them, dairy products are a healthy source of various important nutrients.

Full-fat dairy seems to be the best, and studies show that people who eat the most full-fat dairy have a lower risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes (13, 14Trusted Source).

If the dairy comes from grass-fed cows, it may be even more nutritious — as it’s higher in some bioactive fatty acids like conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and vitamin K2.
</p>
<img src="image/healthy19.jpg" width="40%">

<li>
	<b> Cheese</b>
	<p>

   <h2>Health, sport and wellbeing</h2>
    <p class=" ">During recent decades, there has been a progressive decline in the level of physical activity in people's daily lives in developed countries. For a majority of people, little physical effort is involved any more in their work, domestic chores, transportation and leisure. Whilst specific health risks differ between countries and regions, the fact remains that physical inactivity is a major risk factor for most common non-communicable diseases and physical activity can counteract many of the ill effects of inactivity.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that, with the exception of sub-Saharan Africa, chronic diseases are now the leading causes of death in the world. The WHO cites four non-communicable diseases that make the largest contribution to mortality in low- and middle-income countries, namely: cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic respiratory disease, and diabetes.
   </p>


<p>Physical inactivity is a major risk factor associated with a large number of lifestyle diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and obesity. Sport projects that specifically focus on health outcomes generally emphasise:</p>


<ul>
	
<li>
	The promotion of healthy lifestyle choices among children and young people as well as adults to combat inactivity;
</li>

<li>
Sport is considered to contribute to achieving mental health objectives, including addressing depression and stress-related disorders.	
</li>


<li>
	The use of sport to mobilise hard-to-reach groups as part of large-scale health campaigns, including for example, communities with low population density;
 
</li>

<li>
	The use of sport as a didactical tool to communicate vital health-related information to ‘at risk’ groups;

</li>


<li>The use of sport as a tool to raise awareness on communicable diseases in developing countries, for example, through district or national health campaigns supported by athletes and sports competitions;
</li>




</ul>

<h2>The health benefits of sport and physical activity</h2>
<img src="image/sport4.jpg " width="40%"  >
<p>
Although research interest on physical activity and health dates back to the 1950s, the breakthrough in the scientific evidence on health benefits of physical activity largely took place during the 1980s and 1990s. There is an overwhelming amount of scientific evidence on the positive effects of sport and physical activity as part of a healthy lifestyle. The positive, direct effects of engaging in regular physical activity are particularly apparent in the prevention of several chronic diseases, including: cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, hypertension, obesity, depression and osteoporosis.</p>
<p>
The Report from the United Nations Inter-Agency Task Force on Sport for Development and Peace states that young people can benefit from physical activity as it contributes to developing healthy bones, efficient heart and lung function as well as improved motor skills and cognitive function. Physical activity can help to prevent hip fractures among women and reduce the effects of osteoporosis. Remaining physically active can enhance functional capacity among older people, and can help to maintain quality of life and independence.</p>

<b>Physical activity and psychosocial health</b>
<p>

The WHO has estimated that “one in four patients visiting a health service has at least one mental, neurological or behavioural disorder, but most of these disorders are neither diagnosed nor treated”. A number of studies have shown that exercise may play a therapeutic role in addressing a number of psychological disorders. Studies also show that exercise has a positive influence on depression. Physical self-worth and physical self-perception, including body image, has been linked to improved self-esteem. The evidence relating to health benefits of physical activity predominantly focuses on intra-personal factors such as physiological, cognitive and affective benefits, however, that does not exclude the social and inter-personal benefits of sport and physical activity which can also produce positive health effects in individuals and communities.</p>

<b>Sport and physical activity as part of a healthy lifestyle</b>
<p>
A number of factors influence the way in which sport and physical activity impacts on health in different populations. Sport and physical activity in itself may not directly lead to benefits but, in combination with other factors, can promote healthy lifestyles. There is evidence to suggest that changes in the environment can have a significant impact on opportunities for participation and in addition, the conditions under which the activity is taking place can heavily impact on health outcomes. Elements that may be determinants on health include nutrition, intensity and type of physical activity, appropriate footwear and clothing, climate, injury, stress levels and sleep patterns.
</p>
<p>
Sport and physical activity can make a substantial contribution to the well-being of people in developing countries. Exercise, physical activity and sport have long been used in the treatment and rehabilitation of communicable and non-communicable diseases. Physical activity for individuals is a strong means for the prevention of diseases and for nations is a cost-effective method to improve public health across populations.</p>



<h2>Sport, physical activity and risk factors for major diseases</h2>
<p>
An understanding of the most prevalent diseases and associated risk factors is crucial to conceptualise the role of sport in health prevention and promotion. In developing countries, sport is widely used as a tool to educate individuals and communities on the risk factors associated with HIV/AIDS. Whilst HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases continue to affect millions of people around the world, there is a significant increase in the global burden of non-communicable diseases related to lifestyle changes in physical inactivity, unhealthy diets and tobacco use.
</p>
<b>Cardiovascular diseases</b>

<p>Cardiovascular diseases include coronary heart disease and stroke and are the leading causes of death globally. Causes of cardiovascular disease are unhealthy diets, physical inactivity and tobacco use. Physical activity reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease by improving glucose metabolism, reducing body fat and lowering blood pressure.</p>

<b>Diabetes</b>
<p>Diabetes is a disease which occurs when the body does not produce or properly use insulin and this may result in Type I or Type II diabetes. Diabetes may be prevented, or at least delayed, by weight loss, a healthy lifestyle, in particular, regular physical activity. Diet, drug therapy and physical activity are also major components of the treatment of diabetes.</p>




<b>Obesity</b>
<p>

Obesity is an abnormal accumulation of fat that may impair health and unlike other diseases, social and environmental factors play a significant role in defining obesity. The incidence of obesity is a growing concern internationally with an estimated 400 million obese people in 2005.  The global rise in the incidence of obesity is related to a shift in diet and decreased physical activity levels.
</p>
<b>Cancer</b>
<p>
Cancer is not a single disease with a single type of treatment and in fact, there are over 200 types of cancer involving abnormal growth of cells in different parts of the body. It has been estimated that 40% of all cancers may be prevented by a healthy diet, physical activity and no tobacco use.
</p>
<b>Mental health</b>
<p>
One in four patients visiting a health service has at least one mental, neurological or behavioural disorder (such as depression, anxiety or mood disorders) that may not be diagnosed or treated. There is evidence to suggest that physical activity can reduce the symptoms of depression and can also be help to ameliorate mental well-being through improved mood and self-perception.
</p>
<b>
Physical Activity, Chronic Disease and Communicable Diseases
</b>
<p>
Global trends in physical inactivity claim that more than 60% of adults do not participate in sufficient levels of physical activity and physical inactivity is more prevalent among women, older adults, people from low socio-economic groups and people with disabilities.</p>
<p>
In 2005 it was estimated that 80% of cardiovascular disease deaths occurred in low- and middle-income countries. The prevalence of those suffering from overweight and obesity is increasing in developing countries and even in low-income groups in richer countries. The rise of chronic disease, coupled with the existing burden of communicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, produces a ‘double burden of disease’ on low- and middle-income countries.</p>
<p>
There are a range of methodologies utilised around the world to deliver health promotion and prevention strategies and an interesting example is the emergence of internet-based health information for developing countries. Sport and physical activity, however, remains an attractive low-cost strategy to promote healthy behaviours and lifestyles throughout the lifespan and reduce the burden of chronic diseases on public health systems.

   <h2> Tackling HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases through sport</h2>
   <p>
The World Bank states that communicable diseases are the largest causes of child deaths in the world and are significant causes of preventable deaths among adults in the developing world. Together they claim more than an estimated 15 million lives a year, with over 80% of these deaths occurring in developing countries. </p>
<p>
Sport and physical education have shown that they can play an effective role in the fight against HIV/AIDS by providing a popular site for preventative education. There is also evidence indicating that involvement in sport may help to slow down the disease in individuals who are HIV positive. 
</p>
<p>
In Africa, there is an overwhelming majority of sport programmes addressing health concerns with a particular focus on HIV/AIDS. Most of the sport-for-HIV prevention programmes centre their activities on sharing information and using sport and games to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS prevention measures to minimise the risk of contracting the virus. None of the sport-based programmes provide direct treatment such as ARVs (anti-retroviral treatment) for HIV positive individuals as part of their activities but rather focus on using sport as a method of mobilising youth, women and at-risk target groups for health promotion, prevention and education.
</p>
<p>
HIV/AIDS is usually considered a taboo subject and the creation of safe and informal spaces to discuss HIV/AIDS through sport and games allows young people to learn about steps they can take to protect themselves from this disease and to avoid risky behaviour. A study conducted by MercyCorps on two of their programmes in Liberia and south Sudan has shown that HIV/AIDS knowledge and protective attitude levels of the participants were higher after being involved in their programmes. 
</p>
<p>
The role of sports coaches as role models and mentors has proved a vital component of HIV/AIDS prevention programmes using sport. These coaches can also be peers to other young people of a similar age, with whom buildingrelationships of trust can be easier. The programmes that have proven to be most successful in HIV/AIDS prevention have been those that emphasisedeveloping strong leaders and coaches who offer support and guidance.
</p>
<p>

59% of HIV positive individuals in sub-Saharan Africa are women. A number of actors have attempted to address the impact of this gender bias in HIV/AIDS affected groups through sport. For example, the Go Sisters project in Zambia seeks to provide sports opportunities to girls and young women and to provide factual information pertaining to sexual and reproductive health. The health elements of the Go Sisters ‘message’ goes hand-in-hand with the promotion of young women as peer leaders and coaches for other girls and young women.
</p>
<p>
The use of sport in addressing HIV/AIDS does not only focus on the epidemiological aspects but the social impact of the disease on individuals and communities as well. The EduSport Foundation was created from the ‘bottom-up’ by individuals directly affected by HIV/AIDS, who not only prioritise providing young people in affected communities with life-saving information on preventative and protective measures but also actively promote the social integration of HIV positive individuals into the community through sport and physical activity.
</p>
<b>
Sport and other communicable diseases
</b>
<p>
A number of sports programmes target other communicable diseases in addition to HIV/AIDS. Programmes in countries affected by malaria and tuberculosis, for instance, have also used sport to raise awareness about prevention from these diseases. The Right to Play project called Thailand Migrant SportWorks Project focuses on using sport as a didactical tool to teach children about infectious disease prevention. Experience shows that programmes which aim to show how infection spreads, along with its causes and symptoms are also effective when physical activities and games are used to communicate these ideas. Partnerships between national health agencies and sport-focused organisations have attempted to provide children and young people with ‘active learning’ models in which to better retain and then discuss abstract health concepts.
