  		<h3> What Is Anxiety?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"> 
Feeling extreme fear or worry can be a problem, particularly if it interferes with daily life. There are many types of anxiety disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</p></div>

<h3  > What to know about anxiety</h3>
<p >The American Psychological Association (APA) defines anxiety as “an emotion characterized by feelings of tension, worried thoughts and physical changes like increased blood pressure.”

Knowing the difference between normal feelings of anxiety and an anxiety disorder requiring medical attention can help a person identify and treat the condition.

In this article, we look at the differences between anxiety and anxiety disorder, the different types of anxiety, and the available treatment options.</p>

<h3 >Anxiety</h3>
<p >

When an individual faces potentially harmful or worrying triggers, feelings of anxiety are not only normal but necessary for survival.

Since the earliest days of humanity, the approach of predators and incoming danger sets off alarms in the body and allows evasive action. These alarms become noticeable in the form of a raised heartbeat, sweating, and increased sensitivity to surroundings.

The danger causes a rush of adrenalin, a hormone and chemical messenger in the brain, which in turn triggers these anxious reactions in a process called the “fight-or-flight’ response. This prepares humans to physically confront or flee any potential threats to safety.

For many people, running from larger animals and imminent danger is a less pressing concern than it would have been for early humans. Anxieties now revolve around work, money, family life, health, and other crucial issues that demand a person’s attention without necessarily requiring the ‘fight-or-flight’ reaction.

The nervous feeling before an important life event or during a difficult situation is a natural echo of the original ‘fight-or-flight’ reaction. It can still be essential to survival – anxiety about being hit by a car when crossing the street, for example, means that a person will instinctively look both ways to avoid danger.</p>

<h3>Causes</h3>

<p>The causes of anxiety disorders are complicated. Many might occur at once, some may lead to others, and some might not lead to an anxiety disorder unless another is present.

Possible causes include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		environmental stressors, such as difficulties at work, relationship problems, or family issues
	</li>


<li>
	genetics, as people who have family members with an anxiety disorder are more likely to experience one themselves
</li>

<li>
	medical factors, such as the symptoms of a different disease, the effects of a medication, or the stress of an intensive surgery or prolonged recovery
</li>

<li>
	brain chemistry, as psychologists define many anxiety disorders as misalignments of hormones and electrical signals in the brain
</li>


<li>
	withdrawal from an illicit substance, the effects of which might intensify the impact of other possible causes
</li>





</ul>

<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>Treatments will consist of a combination of psychotherapy, behavioral therapy, and medication.

Alcohol dependence, depression, or other conditions can sometimes have such a strong effect on mental well-being that treating an anxiety disorder must wait until any underlying conditions are brought under control.</p>

<h3>Self-treatment</h3>
<br> 
<img src="image/uga1.jpg" width="40%" >
<br>
<br>
<p>In some cases, a person can treat an anxiety disorder at home without clinical supervision. However, this may not be effective for severe or long-term anxiety disorders.

There are several exercises and actions to help a person cope with milder, more focused, or shorter-term anxiety disorders, including:</p>


<ul>
	<li>
	<b>Stress management: </b>	Learning to manage stress can help limit potential triggers. Organize any upcoming pressures and deadlines, compile lists to make daunting tasks more manageable, and commit to taking time off from study or work.
	</li>
<li>
	<b>Relaxation techniques:</b>  Simple activities can help soothe the mental and physical signs of anxiety. These techniques include meditation, deep breathing exercises, long baths, resting in the dark, and yoga.
</li>

<li>
	<b>Exercises to replace negative thoughts with positive ones:</b>  Make a list of the negative thoughts that might be cycling as a result of anxiety, and write down another list next to it containing positive, believable thoughts to replace them. Creating a mental image of successfully facing and conquering a specific fear can also provide benefits if anxiety symptoms relate to a specific cause, such as in a phobia.
</li>

<li>
	<b> Support network:</b> Talk with familiar people who are supportive, such as a family member or friend. Support group services may also be available in the local area and online.
</li>

<li>
	<b> Exercise: </b>Physical exertion can improve self-image and release chemicals in the brain that trigger positive feelings.
</li>

	<h3>5 Ways to Manage Your Anxiety During the Coronavirus Outbreak</h3>
	<img src="image/anxity2.jpg" width="40%">

<p> It’s borderline impossible to do anything right now without hearing the word "coronavirus." Social media's buzzing with mentions of COVID-19; news sites can't keep up with the ever-developing updates; even stores and online retailers are running out of household items like bleach wipes and hand sanitizer.

The developing panic is real, especially when the only news being disseminated seems to be coronavirus news. And for people who already struggle with anxiety disorders, the daily reminders and updates about coronavirus sweeping the globe is only adding insult to injury.</p>

<p>Of course, coronavirus fears aren't entirely unfounded: According to the latest situation report from the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 88,000 people worldwide have been confirmed as having COVID-19—and more than 100 of those people are here in the US, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The newest cases in the US also suggest community-spread, meaning a person who neither traveled to an affected region or had direct contact with an infected person developed the illness</p>


<h3>1. Assess your own personal risk for contracting the coronavirus.</h3>

<p>You can take a proactive role in your health (and anxiety levels) by figuring out your own personal risk for developing coronavirus. That means determining whether there have been confirmed or presumptive positive cases of the virus in your community, whether you've been exposed to anyone who's been ill recently, and whether you have immune issues or breathing problems that could put you at risk of complications if you were to contract the virus, Alicia H</p>


<p>Those steps aren't to make you even more anxious, but rather, give you a sense of control over your health and susceptibility to the illness. "This analysis of learned information and how it applies to you is important because it puts you in control," says Dr. Clark. “You aren’t just a passive recipient of scary information, but an active participant in judging what you’re learning."  </p>



<h3>2. Try to limit your coronavirus news consumption.</h3>

<p>It's true: You should at least be aware that coronavirus is currently an issue, and know where it's showing up in relation to you. However, there is such a thing as too much news, and constantly reading coronavirus update stories isn't going to help your anxiety levels. "Limit your overall news intake to once every day or so if you find yourself triggered by news, and limit your attention to only reputable news sources," says Dr. Clark. "The more you expose yourself to a scary topic over which you feel limited control, the more you will feel anxious."</p>


<p>If you're unsure about which news sources are truly reputable, you're likely safest sticking to large, national, trustworthy media brands—newspapers like The New York Times and the Washington Post, and online outlets including CNN and NBC News are all constantly updating their coronavirus content, while the CDC refreshes their COVID-19 Situation Summary daily. As far as keeping track of possible outbreaks in your own region goes, stick to your trusted local news stations or newspapers, which are likely getting all of their information from other reputable sources.</p>






<h3>3. Realize that it's totally OK to be worried about the coronavirus outbreak.</h3>

<p>Coronavirus is scary and it’s OK to realize that. “Recognize that your anxiety is normal, but resist inflaming it,” Clark says. Stressing out over the fact that you’re stressed over coronavirus will only make your anxiety worse, she says.

Also important: If someone gives you grief for being anxious about coronavirus, it’s perfectly OK to call them out on it, Ken Yeager, PhD, a psychiatrist at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, tells Health. “Respond with, ‘Well, what are you doing to be prepared?’” he says. If they still insist on minimizing your fears, try to brush them off. “You can ignore them or not make it bigger than it needs to be,” says Yeager.</p>




<h3>4. Follow the correct preventive methods to protect against the coronavirus.</h3>

<p>If you find yourself feeling panicked each time you see a stranger wearing a face mask in public, remember this: The general public truly won't benefit from wearing face masks (yes, even those N95 respiratory masks—and even less so from surgical masks). The CDC does, however, recommend that people do the following to help prevent the spread of coronavirus and other respiratory viruses:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Try to avoid close contact with people who are sick.
	</li>
<li>
Try to avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.
</li>


<li>
Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.</li>
<li> 
	Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom, before eating, and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. (If soap and water aren’t available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.)
	</li>

</ul>

<p>Doing all of those things can help you feel more in control of the situation, Yeager says, which can help ease your anxiety.

</p>

<h3>5. Remind yourself that you're doing the best you can in this situation.</h3>

<p>If you find yourself starting to get worked up over the virus in any given moment, Yeager recommends doing a “grounding technique” to calm down. That involves looking around you, recognizing when you’re in a safe space, like your home, and reminding yourself that you’re doing the best you can. “Know that you’re keeping your home clean and remind yourself that the coronavirus is not in a lot of states now,” he says.</p>

<p>If that doesn’t work, try to think about something that’s in front of you, like noticing a bird flying outside your window or how your desk at work feels beneath your hands. These can serve as good distractions to help break up the negative chain of anxious thinking.</p>


<p>If, despite trying these tips to help quell your coronavirus anxiety, you still feel overwhelmed with anxiety or that your coronavirus fears are interfering with your ability to go about your daily life, Saltz says it’s not a bad idea to talk to a mental health professional. “Some therapy can make a big difference in managing anxiety about all kinds of things, including the coronavirus,” she says.</p>
