<h2> What is the digestive system?</h2>
<p>
The digestive system is made up of the gastrointestinal tract—also called the GI tract or digestive tract—and the liver, pancreas, and gallbladder. The GI tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus. The hollow organs that make up the GI tract are the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and anus. The liver, pancreas, and gallbladder are the solid organs of the digestive system.</p>
<p>

The small intestine has three parts. The first part is called the duodenum. The jejunum is in the middle and the ileum is at the end. The large intestine includes the appendix, cecum, colon, and rectum. The appendix is a finger-shaped pouch attached to the cecum. The cecum is the first part of the large intestine. The colon is next. The rectum is the end of the large intestine.</p>

<h2> Why is digestion important?</h2>
 <img src="image/digs2.jpg" width="50%">
<p>
Digestion is important because your body needs nutrients from food and drink to work properly and stay healthy. Proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins NIH external link, minerals NIH external link, and water are nutrients. Your digestive system breaks nutrients into parts small enough for your body to absorb and use for energy, growth, and cell repair.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Proteins break into amino acids</li>
<li>Fats break into fatty acids and glycerol</li>
<li>Carbohydrates break into simple sugars</li>

</ul>

<h3> How does my digestive system work?</h3>
<p>
Each part of your digestive system helps to move food and liquid through your GI tract, break food and liquid into smaller parts, or both. Once foods are broken into small enough parts, your body can absorb and move the nutrients to where they are needed. Your large intestine absorbs water, and the waste products of digestion become stool. Nerves and hormones help control the digestive process

<h2> Easy Ways to Improve Your Digestive Health (and Lose Weight)</h2>

<p>The idea that your digestive system plays a role in your ability to lose weight makes sense when you take a moment to think it through. When you overeat or consume foods that are hard for your body to break down, your digestion slows and the waste gets compacted within your body. If you’ve ever felt bloated, constipated, or suffered from heartburn or diarrhea, chances are you’re feeling the impact of poor digestive health.</p>


<p>What you may not notice is that over time, a sluggish digestive system and waste buildup leads to weight gain. Follow these tips to ensure that the food you eat today isn’t sitting around inside your body tomorrow night.</p>

 <h3>Get enough digestive enzymes</h3>
  <img src="image/disg3.jpg" width="40%">
 <p>By sticking to a diet high in digestive enzymes and fermented foods, you can keep your system running smoothly. Raw fermented veggies like sauerkraut or kimchi are high in these enzymes, as is miso soup and yogurt. Herbs like peppermint and ginger can be boiled in water to make a tea that will also help move things along.</p>

	<h3> Increase physical activity</h3>
	<img src="image/digs4.jpg" width="40%">
	<p>Not only does exercise burn off those excess calories, it’s also a secret tapping into your body’s healthy digestive process. Being active keeps your digestion moving, resulting in more frequent elimination and weight loss. When you feel constipated, the first thing some doctors recommend is exercising to help move things along</p>

<h3> Drink plenty of water </h3>
<img src="image/digs5.jpg" width="40%">
<p>Being properly hydrated keeps your body functioning properly and helps to flush waste out of your system. The secret is to drink most of your water on an empty stomach or before you eat, which allows the water to go straight to your cells. Drinking water with meals or after a meal can actually dilute your solid foods and hinder your stomach’s ability to digest them quickly and efficiently.</p>

<h3> Pay attention to food combinations</h3>
<img src="image/digs6.jpg" width="40%">
<p>You’ve probably noticed that certain food combinations leave you feeling bloated and upset. This is because while we’ve been told a balanced meal contains protein, starch, and a small serving of vegetables, in reality protein and starch should never be eaten together.</p>
<p>
Fruits and vegetables are digested the quickest, then carbohydrates, and finally protein.</p>

<h3>Healthy amounts of fiber </h3>
<img src="image/digs7.jpg" width="40%">
<p>Fruits, vegetables, and whole grains contain ample amounts of fiber, which is one way to speed up your digestive system. Fiber improves your digestion by pushing food waste and toxins through the body to increase and improve your elimination, resulting in weight loss.</p>

<h3> Limit your caffeine intake </h3>
<img src="image/digs9.jpg" width="40%">
<p>While caffeine is debatably good for your metabolism, it can wreak havoc on your digestive tract. Caffeine acts as a laxative, however it also increases your production of stress hormones. According to Livestrong.com, these stress hormones — cortisol, adrenaline, and norepinephrine — cause your heart to beat faster through increased blood supply.</p>
<p>
This decreases the blood supply to your intestines, slowing digestion. Try digestion-friendly teas instead of coffee to get your morning caffeine fix and boost your metabolism.</p>

<h3>Eat on schedule </h3>
<img src="image/digs8.jpg" width="40%">
<p>Numerous studies have backed the importance of eating consistent, planned meals to keep your weight loss goals in tact. Turns out, consuming your meals and snacks on a regular schedule can help keep your digestive system in top shape as well. The National Weight Control Registry makes a good case for eating a high-protein breakfast between 6 a.m. and 9:45 a.m. to jump-start both your metabolism and your digestive system.</p>
<p>
Restrict nighttime eating to before 7 p.m. While a few slip-ups and late-night snacks won’t hurt you, studies show that setting a cut-off point for your last meal of the day leads to efficient weight loss. Registered dietician Farah Fahad suggests having dinner three hours before your bedtime, “It is a good amount of time … your food gets to digest and you’re not sleeping on a full stomach.”</p>
