    <h2 class="mt-0">What exactly is blurred vision?</h2>
    <p>
    Blurry, unclear, unfocused vision is the most common eyesight problem, and usually it isn’t anything major to worry about it. Blurriness could just be a sign that your glasses or contacts prescription needs updating. Every once in a while though, fuzzy vision signals something more serious.
Always investigate what’s causing your blurry vision. Knowing the reason behind it can be the difference between experiencing the world in all its dimensions or not. “Sight is such a valued sense, but there are still a lot of problems that fall through the cracks,” says Rajiv Shah, MD, assistant professor of ophthalmology at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-0">What Is Macular Degeneration?</h2>
    <p>Put simply, when you hear about macular degeneration, people are generally talking about age-related macular degeneration (AMD). This refers to the breakdown of the central part of the retina, called the macula, which is responsible for the sharpest vision.

“Even though these patients never end up completely blind, they end up with central blind spots which severely limit their vision and daily function as well,” says Dr. Modi. “They have to rely on their peripheral vision, which requires a re-education on how to open bottles, navigate through doorways, and a number of everyday things that we otherwise take for granted.” And people with more advanced AMD often lose the ability to read, drive, see details, and recognize faces and colors.

  <h2  >Easy Ways to Protect Your Eyes at Any Age</h2> 
  <img src="image/image2.jpg"  width="40%">
   
  

    <ul>
   <li><h3>Dont forget your shades.</h3><p> 
You need to fend off the suns ultraviolet rays at every age. Thats because UV rays can cause eye diseases, increased nearsighted­ness, and skin cancer around the eyes, says Alice Lyon, MD, director of vitreoretinal service at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and ophthalmologist at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. Wear sunglasses anytime youre outdoors or driving (keep a spare pair in your car), even if its overcast—UV rays can do harm when its cloudy, too.</p></li> 
    


 
   <li> <h3>Make over your workspace.</h3><p>
Spending hours in front of a computer can cause tired, aching, and dry eyes—and possibly eyestrain headaches, according to the American Optometric Association. Avoid these woes by placing your monitor as far as possible from your eyes, but not so far that you have to squint. Also, look away from the screen periodically to rest your eyes and change focus, and try a low-voltage floor lamp in place of bright overhead lights. An antiglare screen filter (available at most office-supply stores) may help, too.</p></li> 
   




      
     
   <li>	<h3>Look at LASIK.</h3> <p>
Your vision stabilizes by your early 30s, making it an ideal time for this surgical fix, says Clyde Kitchen, MD, an ophthalmologist in California and the author of Fact and Fiction of Healthy Vision: Eye Care for Adults and Children. An eye doc should confirm that youre a good candidate. LASIK does pose some risks: dry eyes, especially during the first six months after the procedure, and occasionally a halo effect during the dusk and evening hours. And note that even with the surgery you may need reading glasses in your 40s.</p></li> 
    

 
   <li><h3>Work up a sweat</h3><p> 
Exercising regularly and maintaining a healthy weight help prevent diabetes, a chief cause of vision impairment that may lead to blindness. “Doctors are diagnosing people in their 40s and 50s with diabetes in nearly epidemic numbers,” says Scott Greenstein, MD, an ophthalmologist at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary and an ophthalmology instructor at Harvard Medical School. To stay out of that club, get at least a half-hour of aerobic exercise three times a week and limit sugary treats.</p></li> 
    




 
   <li><h3>Get checked</h3><p>
The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends a baseline eye-disease screening at age 40 to detect early signs of vision problems like cataracts, which block light from reaching the retina; age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a disease that causes deterioration of the retina; and glaucoma, optic-nerve damage caused by increased pressure in the eye. A full checkup should also include the usual eye-muscle-movement tests and a retinoscopy to check for astigmatism, nearsightedness, and farsightedness. After the baseline screening, follow up with annual eye exams unless your doctor recommends more frequent checks.</p></li>
